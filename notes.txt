Compiling and Running:
rustc main.rs 
./main 

rustfmt - automatic formatter tool:
    - Format code in a particular style

cargo new <name_of_the_project>

cargo build (gotta use the whole path to the binary after executing this)
    - build a project

cargo run (most used)
    - build a project and run it in one step

cargo check 
    - Used to check if the project is still compiling

Cargo stores the results of the build in the target/debug directory

cargo build --release
    - Compile project with optimizations
    - The executable will be created in target/release

Git:
    git clone example.org/someproject
    cd someproject
