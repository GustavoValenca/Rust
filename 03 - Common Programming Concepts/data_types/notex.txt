Rust is a statically typed language which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time

- scalar types
    A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar type:

    - integers
    - floating-point numbers
    - Booleans
    - characters

- Compound types
    Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types:
    
    - tuples
    - arrays
