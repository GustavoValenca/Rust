Vectors can only store values of the same type.

If you want your program to crash if there's an attempt to access an element past the end of the vector, it's best to use the [] method.

You would use the get method if accessing an element beyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal circumstances.

Vectors can only store values that are the same type. This can be inconvenient; there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of items of different types. Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined under the same enum type, so when we need one type to represent elements of different types, we can define and use an enum!
