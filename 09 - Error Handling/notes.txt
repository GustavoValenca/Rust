Rust groups errors into two major categories:
    - recoverable errors
        Report the problem and retry the operation.
        Ex: file not found
    - unrecoverable errors
        Immediately stop the program.
        Ex: trying to access a location beyond the end of an array

By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts unwinding, which means
Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function. However,
is a lot of work. Rust, therefore, allows you to choose the alternative of immediately 
aborting, which ends the program without cleaning up. That memory needs to be cleaned by 
the operating system.
