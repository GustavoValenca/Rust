Compiler:
    - Start from the crate root
    - Declaring modules
    - Declaring submodules
    - Paths to code in modules
    - Private vs public
    - The "use" keyword

if you want to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module 

If we make a enum public, all of its variants are then public, unlike structs.
